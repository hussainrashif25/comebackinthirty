#Comebackinthirty
Comebackinthirty is a time managment app made with Vue.js. Using the client's localstorage, the app stores your daily events in thirty minute time slots. Instead of logging events ahead of time, you would "comebackinthirty" to create, delete or update what you had done. In the future, I am looking forward to implementing this as mobile app by utilzing "Vue Native".
